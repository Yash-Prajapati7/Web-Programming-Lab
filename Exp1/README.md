# Experiment 1 - Responsive E-Commerce Landing Page

## Aim
Design a responsive e-commerce landing page using HTML5 semantic layout tags including informative sections with images, audio, navigation links with a dropdown menu, and apply vanilla CSS features like fonts, colors, borders, margins, padding, navigation, dropdown, and media queries.

## Method
1. **HTML5 Semantic Structure**: Used semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`)
2. **Navigation with Dropdown**: Created a responsive navigation bar with a dropdown menu for product categories
3. **Hero Section**: Implemented a full-width hero section with background image and call-to-action button
4. **Product Cards**: Designed product cards using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` with images, pricing, and descriptions
5. **Audio Element**: Added an HTML5 `<audio>` element for promotional content
6. **CSS Styling**: Applied custom styles for typography, colors, spacing, borders, and layout
7. **Responsive Design**: Implemented media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
